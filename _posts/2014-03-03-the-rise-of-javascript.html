<p>In the last few years <em>Javascript</em> has become quite a popular thing and it looks like it is getting bigger and bigger day by day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752"><img class="aligncenter" alt="cat" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cat.gif" width="180" height="236" /></a></p>
<p>I've recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752">JavaScript Patterns</a> from Stoyan Stefanov and I can say that it is quite a <a href="https://github.com/asierba/Reading-list/">good read</a>. If you want to learn what Javascript really is, go for it!</p>
<p>I remember my first approach to this language about 10 years ago when I was learning the basics of the web. To be honest, I kind of hated it at that time. I thought it was a wrong version of java and too complicated to use - how wrong I was! I would use it for client side html manipulation, which it wasn't easy at all at that time.. specially debugging it was quite hard! So I gave up.</p>
<p>Through the last years with jquery and all those libraries things have changed a lot. Programming javascript became easier and the language started showing up more and more in web browsers.  More js skills were demanded for software developer roles. So I decided to give it another go.</p>
<p>I liked more this time, but I wasn't totally convinced till recently.</p>
<p>It's been the last few months when I am really liking it. And enjoying it! :) I started playing around with unit testing libraries like <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">jasmine</a>, watching some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ifWcnQs6M">videos from Crockford</a> and <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">learning node.js </a>and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a>. I can tell that really I didn't know Javascript! And this have been more clear after I read the book from Stoyan Stefanov.</p>
<p>It's kind of a change of mindset. I am coming from strongly typed class based languages like C# or Java. But Javascript is dynamic typed and prototyped based. I have already came across to dynamic languages with Ruby or PHP, but no having classes is a new thing for me.</p>
<p>I don't think many developers really understand Javascript and because of that they will say it is a secondary language.. Well, I can say that they are wrong!</p>
<p>Javascript is getting more and more and more popular. A lot of client side applications are being written in javascript, there are a lot of libraries out there to do almost everything and now with node things are getting even better. Good proof of that is we are starting to see javascript showing up in the enterprise, <a style="line-height:1.5em;" href="http://www.zdnet.com/how-replacing-java-with-javascript-is-paying-off-for-paypal-7000023697/">paypal has moved from java to javascrip</a><span style="line-height:1.5em;">t! And we will be seeing it even more. There is even people talking that it <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/08/09/why-javascript-will-become-the-dominant-programming-language-of-the-enterprise#awesm=~ouxNeweXo0Wyko">will become the one language</a>. Who knows, time will tell..</span></p>
