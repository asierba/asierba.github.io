<p style="text-align:left;">Second principle in the <a href="http://asierba.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/clean-code-development-red-grade/">red grade</a>, <strong>Keep it simple stupid</strong> or <strong>KISS</strong>.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex, therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided</p></blockquote>
<p>Many times I have seen people overcomplicating things when it comes to software, as if complexity will make a system better. But it is just the opposite!</p>
<p>Complexity is the evil in software systems and ultimately a huge impediment in order to keep our <a href="http://asierba.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/clean-code-development/">code clean</a>. We, as professional developers, have to avoid it at all cost. Keep everything as simple as possible. Build systems based in simplicity, with small classes and small methods, also <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/07/coding-without-comments.html">avoid writing comments as much as possible</a> - write a minimalistic code.</p>
<p>And don't just focus in the code when it comes to the KISS principle. Do not add features to your software that <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt">you are not going to need</a>, <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/Practices/PracSimplest.html">do the simplest work that could possibly work</a>, design simple to use interfaces, <a href="http://asierba.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/beware-of-optimisation/">beware of optimisation</a>, <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Documentation_Is_Evil">create the minimum documentation</a>, and keep your processes simple following the agile/lean methodologies.</p>
<p>Simplistic software systems are easy to maintain, are easy to refactor and definitely easy to evolve. In this ever-changing world that we are living were markets, products, customers are changing constantly simplicity is a-must and a key to success.</p>
<p>As Leonardo Da Vinci once quoted and then became an Apple slogan in the 77</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Also, as a personal advise do not embrace  simplicity just in software, <a href="http://zenhabits.net/the-many-paths-to-simplicity/">embrace it in your everyday life</a>! :)</p>
