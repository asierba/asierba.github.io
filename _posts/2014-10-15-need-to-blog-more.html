<p>It's been a while since I don't write a blogpost. I should be doing it more often.</p>
<p>I could mention various excuses, but the only true is that I've been a bit lazy..</p>
<p>Writing a blogpost requires a lot of time and thinking from me. Or that's at least the idea I have in my head. I try to write long blogposts with amazing topic. Then I see the results and I am not happy with them.</p>
<p>The problem is that... I suck at it! Yes, I am not good at it. Yet.</p>
<p>I need a change.</p>
<p>It's well known, practice make the master. So what's the best way to improve? Write more and more and more!</p>
<p>So from now on I will post frequent little blogposts. I will make them short so the task is less daunting for me and hopefully more enjoyable for you :)</p>
