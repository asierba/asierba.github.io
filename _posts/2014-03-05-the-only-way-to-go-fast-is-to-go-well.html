<blockquote><a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Speed_Kills">The only way to go fast is to go well. </a></p>
<p>- Robert C. Martin</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">Uncle bob</a> is a big advocate of writing high quality code or <em>clean code</em> as he likes to call it. He says the success of software projects are strongly related in their internal quality. The lower the quality of the code the more difficult will be to make changes to it.</p>
<p>Software projects with low quality will make delivery schedules to get postponed and thus big amounts of money got lost. This will create bigger pressure in the project making developers to go for the <em>quick and dirty</em> way. As a snowball effect quality will go down down down.. Every new change will make the code even worse and harder to make more changes in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, for a successful delivery of a project <strong>quality is paramount</strong>. Every day developers will have to keep their code base <em>clean</em> and avoid the quick and dirty option. Even if management is pressuring them! Going <em>dirty</em> will never be <em>quick</em> at the end of the day. The dirty way will slow us down. It will be foolish. Thus, The only way to go fast is to go well.</p>
<p>Practices as unit testing, TDD, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/refactor.html">mercilessly refactoring</a>, <a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule">keeping the background cleaner than you found it</a> and giving honest estimates will help in the matter. I like to keep my code clean, taking extra care. Small classes with small methods with the right names, etc.  It is not an easy task to be honest. Just practice and experience can teach you. Still I have much too learn!</p>
<p>Also I highly recommend reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean code by Robert C. Martin</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck and keep that code clean! :)</p>
