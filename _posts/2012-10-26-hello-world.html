<p>Hi dear reader,</p>
<p>This is my first post of my blog about software development.Â The idea is to write some stuff with the aim of learning from it. Because the best way of learning is teaching to others! :)</p>
<p>As Albert Einsten said once:</p>
<blockquote><p>You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.</p></blockquote>
<p>We will see how it goes..</p>
