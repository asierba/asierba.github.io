<p>I got to the conclusion that the successful delivery of software is <strong>all down to care</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have <em>developers</em> who care they will write clean code, with unit test and follow TDD approach. The code will be easy to change, enabling the business to make quick decisions against the market so they can beat their competitors.</p>
<p>If you have <em>product owners (or project managers)</em> who care they will try to bring the best features to their products. They will speak to developers and testers and define together the best possible solutions and refine their features in the process.</p>
<p>If you have <em>testers</em> who care they will try to understand the features that are being request to be developed. They will stablish conversations with business people and developers so they will know which tests to write in order to verify the product is working as expected.</p>
<p>If you have <em>operations</em> people who care they will enable their systems for easy deployments. They will talk with developers and give them the power to easily change their code in production while giving technical advise.</p>
<p>In general, if you have <em>people who care they will try to do their best</em> while looking for ways to improve.</p>
<p>If you are one of that many companies struggling with your software delivery my advise is simple: <strong>hire people who care!Â </strong>That would be the first step, after that everything will come together slowly.</p>
