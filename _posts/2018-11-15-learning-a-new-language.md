title:  "Learning a new language"
---

I enjoy learning programming languages all the time. As a programmer I think there is a huge benefit of knowing multiple languages, you can learn many things from each of them. 

When learning a new one this is the approach I tend to follow:

# Brief overview of the language #
To begin with I like getting a general overview of the language. Is this an object oriented language or function? static or dynamic? how is this language different from another? etc. 
Wikipedia is a good place to start. Currently I am learning Java, so I would go to the [java wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).

To have a first look to the syntax and language constructs I like having a look to the language at [Learn X in Y Minutes](learnxinyminutes.com). It's a website where you can quickly read through the basics of any language. It doesn't go deep, but it's a good start and it's based in code examples. Simple! Here the java version: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/

# Koans #
Once I have a grasp of the language I like learning the basics by writing some code. I will look for koans for that. Koans are small set of exercises that will guide you into the basics of a language. Usually koans are a bunch of incomplete or failing unit tests that you will have to fix. For example I've been doing this [Java koans](https://github.com/matyb/java-koans) in the past few days.

You can search for Koans on [github](https://github.com/search?q=koans) or google, almost all modern languages have some. There are even versions that you can just run in your browser like [the ES6 ones](http://es6katas.org/) .

# Katas #
After I finish with the Koans I like practicing with something a bit bigger, but nothing too serious, I like doing a couple of katas with TDD. I usually pick the [FizzBuzz and RomanNumeral katas](https://github.com/asierba/polyglot). 

FizzBuzz is simple enough that I don't have to focus much in the language per-se, but in the ecosystem: I will need to pick a unit testing library and a package manager and learn how to use then. I will also need to learn how to run a console app.

Roman Numerals is a bit more complex, I forces me to dig a bit more into the languages with loops and collections.

# Pet Project #
When I've done a few Katas I can say I know the basics of the language and the most natural way to evolve will be to put it in practice with something bigger: [a breakable toy](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/ch05s03.html). Usually I would build a small website, a console app or a desktop application. This will force me to investigate about different frameworks and tools whilst I improve my knowledge about the language. 
This is a nice environment to experiment and try different things without risks.

# Dig deeper #
Just practicing with katas and pet projects won't make you and expert. If you really want to be good with a language you will have to fully embrace it:
* Stackoverflow
* Read books
* [Read the spec](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/)
* Subscribe to podcasts
* Go to meetups and conferences
* Use it at work
* ...

Hope this helps and good luck! :)
