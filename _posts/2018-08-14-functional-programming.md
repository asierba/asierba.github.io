title:  "Functional Programming"
---

In the last few years my coding style has transitioned from an object oriented to a more functional style.
I see a huge benefit on embracing ideas from the functional paradigm, even when using an object oriented language.

In the following days I am going to write a few blog posts to describe how my style has changed and why I think that's beneficial.

These are the contents I am planning to through: 
* Imperative vs Declarative
* Immutability
* No loops
* Option type - no nulls
* Error handling without exceptions
* Partial application / Currying
* Function composition - OO Design patterns in a functional world.
* Mocking/unit testing and DI.
