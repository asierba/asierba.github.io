**Reflection** is one of the best ways to learn. We learn by doing, but if we don't think about it after that this learning may banish from our brain.
Trying to remember something is the fastest way to learn something, this is known as [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall).

A journal is a good way to do self-reflection. Just write a small piece of text every day. Write whatever you learnt that day. It doesn't matter if you keep it for yourself or you put it online for everybody. Just do it!

The act of writing it it will make you reflect on that. This will ultimately will make you remember it better in the future.

Also, writing is hard. Getting better at it is improve your communication skills and, belive me, that's a skill quite vauable for software developers.

I want to build this practice on me. Write one blogpost per day. Is going to be hard to build the habit, but I want to give it a go. My intention is to make this public so everybody can read it. This will force me to be better at it and at the same time I will share my thoughts with the rest of the world. Who knows? Maybe somebody might find them usefull one day :)

I also got a blogpost: [asierba.net](http://asierba.net). I might merge this two together.
