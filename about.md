I am Asier Barrenetxea. I live in London.

I have been a **software developer** professionally for the last 8 years, but I have been programming just for fun from a long-long time ago!

I love Agile, TDD and Clean code. But over all the [software craftsmanship movement](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

I like **learning** and failing and and learning from my failures. [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) is my motto. Not just professionally, also in my day to day life. I enjoy exploring new things and getting better all the time.

You can follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/asier_ba) or see my curriculum in [linkedin](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/asierba). Sometimes I will push some code to [github](http://github.com/asierba).
